         Following the Korean War, there was a second wave of Korean immigrants to the United States. The defeat of Japan in the second world war, many Koreans from freeded Japanese’s colonization, however things were not so simple following the war. Between the split of Korea in the Korean War resulting in many casualties,  many children became orphaned or was separated from their families. There were tens of thousands of orphaned and needy children in South Korea the years following. Many of these children were adopted by American families to start their new life. International adoption of Korean children was becoming more popular in the United States which led to the establishment of the Holt Adoption Agency. Unfortunately, some parents were unable to support their children and used the orphanage as a means of child care. “Abandoned by their impoverished mothers and shunned by society, many orphan children were sent abroad for adoption” (Cho). What started as a genuine program to get children the care they need became more of a business. The adoption agencies began taking advantage of the situation and even went as far as filing false paperwork for these children. Once these children were actually adopted to the United States there still wasn’t quite a happy ending. Being Asian among white children can be very difficult. They may feel excluded or even attacked for being different from the American children. One of the issues they may face growing up in the United States is the loss of their identity and culture. They are disconnected from their homeland Korea in a community that may not necessarily accept them. There are many different personal experiences, however there are some of the hardships many have faced.
