         During the Korean War, Camptowns emerged outside military bases because they naturally produced jobs for the poor local Koreans as well provided them a way to make a living.. One of the jobs for women is prostitution servicing GI’s. Between the 1950’s and 1970’s, lots of mixed - race children were born in these camptowns, whose fathers were American soldiers and the mothers were camptown women. Camptown women were degraded by society due to working as cooks, prostitutes, maids or other low-paying jobs caused by poverty; they often supported not only themselves, but they also supported their parents, grandparents and siblings all by themselves.  After the GIs returned to the U.S., these single mothers with their children were left to face hardship as well  inequality in Korean society. Therefore, they waited for their children’s fathers to come back to escape from their harsh life in camptowns. Unfortunately, most of the G.I.’s didn’t return because of lack of interest to returning to Korea and continuing military duty. These women had to raise their mixed-race children by themselves where they would be shunned by society. As a result, the mothers tried to look for a better place to find equal opportunities for their children and believed that America would be the ideal country where their mixed-race children could be socially be accepted as who they are and as well fit in.  Even though it is difficult to separate from their children, these mothers put their children up for adoption In the hope that their children will have better lives. From the end of the Korean War to 1998, approximately 100,000 Korean children were adopted to the United States and 40,000 of these children were mixed-race children. During the Korean War, President Syngman Rhee targeted these mixed-race children as social outcasts.  Therefore, they had less opportunity and were abused physically and verbally by adults and other children. The country needed to get rid of them by dumping the mixed- race babies into the ocean and put them for adoption abroad to embrace the ideology of one nation and one race, which is President Rhee’s ideology. He didn’t think the mixed-race children conform to Korean society. Around that time in America, there was a large demand for white babies, but not enough of them to fulfill the demand, therefore mixed-babies were a good adoption alternative for couples without children. These children struggled to fit into American society because of their physical characteristics and lack of similar race people depicted in the media.
