        K.W. Lee, the godfather of Asian American journalism, studied journalism at University of Illinois in 1955 and received his master’s degree and became the first Asian immigrant report at a major U.S newspaper working in for Kingsport Times and News and Charleston Gazette. He is one example of six thousand successful Korean immigrants that studied in the United States between 1945 and 1965. The U.S’s project of rebuilding South Korea invested about 60 million US dollars in directing educational reconstruction projects. Through these reconstructional programs in South Korea, the United States wanted to make sure that South Korea establishes the U.S as an ally as well strengthen their ties for future generations. They as well have brought in professionals from the U.S to educate the South Koreans in education, medicine, engineering , and many other fields to make them become more independent in overseeing the reconstruction. Through this, many young Koreans went to the U.S to study in the universities and colleges to study as well be developed in the many programs the universities and colleges had in place for them. Some of the pressures they felt is when their parents sacrifice their own well-being to give them a better future as well upward mobility to be successful in the United States in pursuit of the American Dream. Some challenges they faced is that they felt obligated to help their parents in an elderly age because once they have become well-educated and successful to help them.
